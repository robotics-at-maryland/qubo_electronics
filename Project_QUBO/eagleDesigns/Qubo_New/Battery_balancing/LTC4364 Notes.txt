LTC4364 Notes
	-M1 is normally fully on
	-When there is an overvoltage, the voltage amplifier controls the M1 gate and regulates
	 the voltage at the OUT pin set by the external resistive divider to ground and the internal 1.25 V reference
	-Overcurrent can be detected by the current sensing resistor between the SENSE and OUT pins
	-An IA (active current limit circuit) controls the gate of M1 to limit the sense voltage to 50mV if OUT is above 2.5V
	-During OV or OI event, a current source starts charging the TMR cap.  The pull-up current source in an OI event is 5 
	 times that of one in an OC event.  When TMR reaches 1.25V, FLT pulls low to warn impending turn off.  M1 stays on until
	 TMR reaches 1.35V, at which point HGATE pulls low and turns off M1. 
	-Fault timer period decreases with voltage across the MOSFET
	-If HGATE is latched low, briefly pulling SHDN below 0.5V resets the fault and lets HGATE pull high
	-The source and drain of MOSFET M2 act as the anode and cathode of the ideal diode
	-DGATE maintains a 30mV voltage across source and drain of M2.
	-If a reverse voltage exceeding -30mV flows across M2, DGATE pulls low and turns off M2
	-If VCC falls below GND voltage, DGATE is pulled to SOURCE pin voltage, keeping M2 off.  
	-If HGATE pulls low, DGATE also pulls low
	-If the output drops below GND, HGATE is pulled to SOURCE pin voltage, turning M1 off and shutting down the forward current
	 path
	-If UV detects an undervoltage, HGATE and DGATE remain low if UV is below its 1.25V threshold.  SHDN turns off both the
	 pass devices and internal circuitry, reducing supply current to 10uA.
